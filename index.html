            My name is Day Littwin and I am a recent graduate full of potential. I graduated from the University of
            Illinois: Springfield with a GPA of 3.70 and I was selected as one of two honors students for the computer
            science department. Previously, I earned my Associate's degree from Sauk Valley Community College. There, I
            graduated with a GPA of 3.66, consistently made the dean's or president's list, and was a member of Phi
            Theta Kappa. I also had the opportunity to attend an honor's class in C++ programming focused on teamwork
            and artificial intelligence development. I look forward to hearing from you soon! <br>
