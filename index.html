            My name is Day Littwin and I am a recent graduate full of potential. I graduated from the University of
            Illinois at Springfield with a GPA of 3.70. I was selected as one of two honors students to represent the
            computer science department in 2021. In 2019, I attended Sauk Valley Community College to earn my
            Associate's Degree. I graduated from Sauk Valley Community College with a GPA of 3.66, consistently made the
            dean's or president's list, and was a member of Phi Theta Kappa. I also had the opportunity to attend an
            honor's class in C++ programming which was focused on teamwork and artificial intelligence.
            I am currently looking for a <strong>Software Development</strong> position in <strong>Chicago,
                Ilinois</strong>.

                        In this position, I was responsible for finding elusive bugs in Android applications and then
                        documenting the steps to replicate them. I also helped pitch new app ideas.
                        One of my ideas was approved for creation, and I was given the chance to program and design a
                        mobile game in Visual Studio.
